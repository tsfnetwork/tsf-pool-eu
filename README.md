### Features  

**This pool is being further developed to provide an easy to use pool for Perkle miners. Testing and bug submissions are welcome!**

* Updated to work with Perkle 0.2.1
* Support for HTTP and Stratum mining
* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
* Failover geth instances: geth high availability built in
* Modern beautiful Ember.js frontend
* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
* JSON-API for stats
* PPLNS block reward
* Multi-tx payout at once
* Beautiful front-end highcharts embedded

#### Proxies

* [Ether-Proxy](https://github.com/sammy007/ether-proxy) HTTP proxy with web interface
* [Stratum Proxy](https://github.com/Atrides/eth-proxy) for Ethereum

## Guide to make your very own Perkle mining pool

### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.10
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs >= 4 LTS
  * nginx
  * geth (multi-geth)

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.**

### Install go lang

    $ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential golang-1.10-go unzip
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.10/bin/go /usr/local/bin/go

### Install redis-server

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

It is recommended to bind your DB address on 127.0.0.1 or on internal ip. Also, please set up the password for advanced security!!!

### Install nginx

    $ sudo apt-get install nginx

sample config located at configs/nginx.default.example (HINT, edit and move to /etc/nginx/sites-available/default)

### Install NODE

This will install the latest nodejs

    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

### Install Perkle Node 
See https://github.com/esprezzo/perkle

### Install Perkle Pool

    $ git clone https://github.com/esprezzo/open-perkle-pool
    $ cd open-perkle-pool
    $ make all

If you see open-perkle-pool after ls ~/open-perkle-pool/build/bin/, the installation has completed.

    $ ls ~/open-perkle-pool/build/bin/

### Set up Perkle pool

    $ mv config.example.json config.json
    $ nano config.json

Set up based on commands below.

  }
}
```

If you are distributing your pool deployment to several servers or processes,
create several configs and disable unneeded modules on each server. (Advanced users)

I recommend this deployment strategy:

* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)
* Unlocker and payouts instance - 1x each (strict!)
* API instance - 1x


### Run Pool
It is required to run pool by serviced. If it is not, the terminal could be stopped, and pool doesnâ€™t work.

    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/etherpool.service

Copy the following example

```
[Unit]
Description=Etherpool
After=perkle.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/<your-user-name>/open-perkle-pool/build/bin/open-perkle-pool /home/<your-user-name>/open-perkle-pool/config.json

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run pool by the following commands

    $ sudo systemctl enable etherpool
    $ sudo systemctl start etherpool

If you want to debug the node command

    $ sudo systemctl status etherpool

Backend operation has completed so far.

### Open Firewall

Firewall should be opened to operate this service. Whether Ubuntu firewall is basically opened or not, the firewall should be opened based on your situation.
You can open firewall by opening 80,443,8080,8888,8008.

## Install Frontend

### Modify configuration file

    $ nano ~/open-perkle-pool/www/config/environment.js

Make some modifications in these settings.

    BrowserTitle: 'Perkle Mining Pool',
    ApiUrl: '//your-pool-domain/',
    HttpHost: 'http://your-pool-domain',
    StratumHost: 'your-pool-domain',
    PoolFee: '1%',

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

    $ cd ~/open-perkle-pool/www
    $ sudo npm install -g ember-cli@2.9.1
    $ sudo npm install -g bower
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ ./build.sh
    $ cp -R ~/open-perkle-pool/www/dist ~/www

As you can see above, the frontend of the pool homepage is created. Then, move to the directory, www, which services the file.

Set up nginx.

    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Modify based on configuration file.

    # Default server configuration
    # nginx example

    upstream api {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        root /home/<your-user-name>/www;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /api {
                proxy_pass http://api;
        }

    }

After setting nginx is completed, run the command below.

    $ sudo service nginx restart

Type your homepage address or IP address on the web.
If you face screen without any issues, pool installation has completed.

### Extra) How To Secure the pool frontend with Let's Encrypt (https)

This guide was originally referred from [digitalocean - How To Secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)

First, install the Certbot's Nginx package with apt-get

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
```

And then open your nginx setting file, make sure the server name is configured!

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
. . .
server_name <your-pool-domain>;
. . .
```

Change the _ to your pool domain, and now you can obtain your auto-renewaled ssl certificate for free!

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-pool-domain>
```

Now you can access your pool's frontend via https! Share your pool link!

### Notes

* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.
* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.
* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.
* Don't run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.
* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.
* DO NOT OPEN YOUR RPC OR REDIS ON 0.0.0.0!!! It will eventually cause coin theft.
